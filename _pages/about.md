Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, with expertise in quantum computing, quantum machine learning (QML), and quantum security. My research focuses on developing robust frameworks to address vulnerabilities in quantum systems, including adversarial attack detection in QML, secure multi-tenant quantum hardware allocation, and optimization of trapped-ion quantum compilers. I am advised by Prof. [Swaroop Ghosh]([https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=szg212]) and collaborate on projects spanning quantum-cloud security, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.  

Prior to Penn State, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from BITS Pilani, where I cultivated foundational skills in hardware design and fabrication. I also worked as a Research Assistant at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, IISc Bangalore, developing high-performance AlGaN/GaN HEMT devices for power applications. My work has resulted in multiple provisional patents, peer-reviewed publications, and recognition such as the Melvin P. Bloom Fellowship and Best Poster Award at IEEE-ICEE. Proficient in optimization, digital integrated circuits, RTL design, and device fabrication, I bring a well-rounded technical skillset to tackle complex problems at the intersection of quantum technology and hardware engineering.  

I am passionate about bridging theoretical quantum advancements with practical hardware implementations, ensuring security and efficiency in next-generation computing systems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
